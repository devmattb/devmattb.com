                     Matt is a driven young buck who aspires to be a great leader, and one of the most well-documented entrepreneurs of his generation. Matt is currently pursuing a Computer Science Bachelor's Degree from The Royal Institiute of Technology (KTH), in Stockholm, and will recieve his degree in June, 2019. He also co-founded a limited IT company by the name MMR Solutions AB, in May 2018, which he currently has the role of CTO in.

                     Matt has experience in web and game development, and has been programming since he was 14 years old. He knows how to code in over 10 programming languages. Because of this, he is MMR Solutions IT-guru.

                    But Matt hasn't only sat in front of the computer. In 2012, he was a centerpiece in a basketball team that won the silver medal in the National Championship in Sweden. He was also voted "Role Model" of the class, every year between 2009-2013. Similar remarks has been made by teachers he had between 2013-2016.

                <div>
                    Additionally, Matt is a extremely social and driven person who also runs a Youtube Channel where hundreds of people view his videos, with a total watch time of over 7000 minutes - a number which is, to this day, rising. 
                </div><br/>

                <div>
                    Furthermore, Matt gives lectures in schools, acting as an ambassador of the developer profession, with the purpose of diversifying the tech industry and decrease the shortage of software engineers. This is also documented on his Youtube Channel.

                    Matt’s mission is to expose himself to as many learning opportunities as possible, share his findings, and inspire people along the way. He wants to provide value for people who aspire to live healthy and happy lives, while at the same time attracting driven people to his digital circle.
